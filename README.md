# SRF-BARCODE
A lightweight Flask-based barcode generation system designed for SRFâ€™s nylon thread tracking workflow. This app connects to a server-hosted PDF log file, extracts production data, and calculates the total actual length of nylon threads used. It then generates a barcode with just the total value for easy scanning, tracking, and labeling.
